# C# Design Patterns  
Practicing 23 Gang of Four object oriented design patterns.     
## Creational Design Patterns   
1. Factory Method  - conditionally produces an object using polymorphism   
2. Abstract Factory Method - includes multiple factory methods in an abstract class  
3. Singleton - thread-safe single self-contained instance is shared across the program  
4. Builder - A director controls the builder to build various products of the similar construction process  
5. Prototype - A prototype (a new instance with the same properties) can be easily created (can be done with ICloneable interface)
